<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Dinoteeth is a small footprint ripped media player that only depends on python and pyglet (plus some external media player like mplayer).  Its goal is to run on the <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> ARM linux machine.</p>
<p>Conceptually it&#8217;s like mythtv or xbmc, but without the ability to record anything.  It&#8217;s designed for ripped media only.</p>
<p>Its strength is the ability to handle bonus features of ripped DVDs, which I found to be lacking in other media managers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t intend to compete with mythtv or xbmc at all.  If you find this useful, then great!  If not, no big deal; I wrote it as an experiment. :)</p>

<h2>About the name</h2>
<p>The name &#8220;dinoteeth&#8221; is an homage to <a title="Dinosaur's Binket" href="http://www.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Binkit-Sandra-Boynton/dp/0689822030/ref=tmm_other_title_0">Dinosaur&#8217;s Binket</a>, a board book by <a title="Sandra Boynton" href="http://www.sandraboynton.com">Sandra Boynton</a> that we&#8217;ve enjoyed reading to our son.</p>
